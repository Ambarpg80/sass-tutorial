This is a tutorial I followed to learn about Sass on Youtube from [freecodeCamp]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs&t=2094s").


Extension Quick Start Guide(not part of the tutorial).I used this to setup the extension because the tutorial was from 2019 and the original LiveSass extenesion for VSCode by Ritwick Dey has been deprecated for this one from Glenn Marks which offered the tutorial below regarding setup.
